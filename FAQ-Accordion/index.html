                        The purpose of a FAQ is generally to provide information on frequent questions or concerns;
                        however, the format is a useful means of organizing information, and text consisting of
                        questions and their answers may thus be called a FAQ regardless of whether the questions are
                        actually frequently asked.

                        Your FAQ page should address the most common questions customers have about your products,
                        services, and brand as a whole. The best way to identify those questions is to tap into your
                        customer service data and see which problems customers are consistently reaching out to you
                        with.

                        They're short, sharp, and straight to the point. FAQ pages should be a one-stop shop that
                        answers several customer questions, from product information to shipping and services. They're
                        for the customers that want information they can use. Blog posts, on the other hand, wander
                        deeper into various subjects.
